## Data Storage and Security

## Third-Party Services

### Plex

- You authenticate directly with Plex's servers
- Your media streaming occurs between your device and your Plex Media Server
- Plex's own privacy policy applies to their services: https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/

We do not control and are not responsible for Plex's data practices.

## Data Sharing

We do not:
- Sell your personal information
- Share your information with third parties for marketing purposes
- Transmit your data to our own servers
- Track your viewing habits outside of local app functionality

Your data is only shared with:
- **Plex services** for authentication and media server communication (as required for the app to function)

## Your Rights and Choices

You can:
- **Sign out** at any time to remove your authentication session from the device
- **Uninstall the app** to remove all locally stored data
- **Manage your Plex account** directly through Plex's services

## Children's Privacy

Plezy does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app relies on Plex account authentication, and users must comply with Plex's terms of service and age requirements.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Data Retention

- Authentication tokens are retained on your device until you sign out or uninstall the app
- Local preferences and settings are retained until you uninstall the app
- No data is retained on our servers as we do not operate any backend services
